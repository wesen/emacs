T
=

t
     n.  1. a. the boolean representing true.  b. the canonical
     generalized boolean representing true.  (Although any object other
     than ‘nil’ is considered true as a generalized boolean, ‘t’ is
     generally used when there is no special reason to prefer one such
     object over another.)  2. the name of the type to which all
     objects belong--the supertype of all types (including itself).  3.
     the name of the superclass of all classes except itself.

tag  n. 
     1. a catch tag.  2. a go tag.

tail  n. (of a list)
     an object that is the same as either some cons which makes up that
     list or the atom (if any) which terminates the list.  "The empty
     list is a tail of every proper list."

target  n. 
     1. (of a constructed stream) a constituent of the constructed
     stream.  "The target of a synonym stream is the value of its
     synonym stream symbol."  2. (of a displaced array) the array to
     which the displaced array is displaced.  (In the case of a chain
     of constructed streams or displaced arrays, the unqualified term
     "target" always refers to the immediate target of the first item
     in the chain, not the immediate target of the last item.)

terminal I/O  n. 
     the bidirectional stream that is the value of the variable
     ‘*terminal-io*’.

terminating  n. (of a macro character)
     being such that, if it appears while parsing a token, it
     terminates that token.  See *note Section 2.2 (Reader Algorithm):
     Reader Algorithm.

tertiary value  n. (of values resulting from the
     evaluation of a form) the third value, if any, or else ‘nil’ if
     there are fewer than three values.

throw  v. 
     to transfer control and values to a catch.  See the special
     operator *note throw::.

tilde  n.
     the standard character that is called "tilde" (‘~’).  See *note
     Figure 2.5: StdCharsThree.

time
     a representation of a point (absolute time) or an interval
     (relative time) on a time line.  See *note decoded time:
     glos-decoded time, internal time, and universal time.

time zone  n.
     a rational multiple of ‘1/3600’ between ‘-24’ (inclusive) and ‘24’
     (inclusive) that represents a time zone as a number of hours
     offset from Greenwich Mean Time.  Time zone values increase with
     motion to the west, so   Massachusetts, U.S.A. is in time zone ‘5’,
     California, U.S.A. is time zone ‘8’, and Moscow, Russia is time
     zone -3.  (When "daylight savings time" is separately represented
     as an argument or return value, the time zone that accompanies it
     does not depend on whether daylight savings time is in effect.)

token  n.
     a textual representation for a number or a symbol.  See *note
     Section 2.3 (Interpretation of Tokens): Interpretation of Tokens.

top level form  n. 
     a form which is processed specially by ‘compile-file’ for the
     purposes of enabling compile time evaluation of that form.  Top
     level forms include those forms which are not subforms of any
     other form, and certain other cases.  See *note Section 3.2.3.1
     (Processing of Top Level Forms): TopLevelForms.

trace output  n. 
     the output stream which is the value of the dynamic variable
     ‘*trace-output*’.

tree  n. 
     1. a binary recursive data structure made up of conses and atoms:
     the conses are themselves also trees (sometimes called "subtrees"
     or "branches"), and the atoms are terminal nodes (sometimes called
     leaves). Typically, the leaves represent data while the branches
     establish some relationship among that data.  2. in general, any
     recursive data structure that has some notion of "branches" and
     leaves.

tree structure  n. (of a tree₁)
     the set of conses that make up the tree.  Note that while the
     car[1b] component of each such cons is part of the tree structure,
     the objects that are the cars₂ of each cons in the tree are not
     themselves part of its tree structure unless they are also conses.

true  n. 
     any object that is not false and that is used to represent the
     success of a predicate test.  See *note t: glos-t.₁.

truename  n. 
     1. the canonical filename of a file in the file system.  See *note
     Section 20.1.3 (Truenames): Truenames.  2. a pathname representing
     a truename₁.

two-way stream  n. 
     a stream of type ‘two-way-stream’, which is a bidirectional
     composite stream that receives its input  from an associated input
     stream and sends    its output to   an associated output stream.

type  n. 
     1. a set of objects, usually with common structure, behavior, or
     purpose.  (Note that the expression "X is of type S_A" naturally
     implies that "X is of type S_B" if S_A is a subtype of S_B.)  2.
     (immediately following the name of a type) a subtype of that type.
     "The type ‘vector’ is an array type."

type declaration  n. 
     a declaration that asserts that every reference to a specified
     binding within the scope of the declaration results in some object
     of the specified type.

type equivalent  adj. (of two types X and Y)
     having the same elements; that is, X is a subtype of Y and Y is a
     subtype of X.

type expand  n.
     to fully expand a type specifier, removing any references to
     derived types.  (Common Lisp provides no program interface to cause
     this to occur, but the semantics of Common Lisp are such that every
     implementation must be able to do this internally, and some
     situations involving type specifiers are most easily described in
     terms of a fully expanded type specifier.)

type specifier  n. 
     an expression that denotes a type.  "The symbol ‘random-state’,
     the list ‘(integer 3 5)’, the list ‘(and list (not null))’, and
     the class named ‘standard-class’ are type specifiers."

U
=

unbound
     adj.  not having an associated denotation in a binding.  See *note
     bound: glos-bound.

unbound variable  n.
     a name that is syntactically plausible as the name of a variable
     but which is not bound in the variable namespace.

undefined function  n.
     a name that is syntactically plausible as the name of a function
     but which is not bound in the function namespace.

unintern  v.t. (a symbol in a package)
     to make the symbol not be present in that package.  (The symbol
     might continue to be accessible by inheritance.)

uninterned  adj. (of a symbol)
     not accessible in any package; i.e., not interned₁.

universal time  n.
     time, represented as a non-negative integer number of seconds.
     Absolute universal time is measured as an offset from the
     beginning of the year 1900 (ignoring leap seconds).  See *note
     Section 25.1.4.2 (Universal Time): UniversalTime.

unqualified method  n. 
     a method with no qualifiers.

unregistered package  n.
     a package object that is not present in the package registry.  An
     unregistered package has no name; i.e., its name is ‘nil’.  See
     the function *note delete-package::.

unsafe  adj. (of code)
     not safe.  (Note that, unless explicitly specified otherwise, if a
     particular kind of error checking is guaranteed only in a safe
     context, the same checking might or might not occur in that
     context if it were unsafe; describing a context as unsafe means
     that certain kinds of error checking are not reliably enabled but
     does not guarantee that error checking is definitely disabled.)

unsafe call  n.
     a call that is not a safe call.  For more detailed information,
     see *note Section 3.5.1.1 (Safe and Unsafe Calls):
     SafeAndUnsafeCalls.

upgrade  v.t. (a declared type to an actual type)
     1. (when creating an array) to substitute an actual array element
     type for an expressed array element type when choosing an
     appropriately specialized array representation.  See the function
     *note upgraded-array-element-type::.  2. (when creating a complex)
     to substitute an actual complex part type for an expressed complex
     part type when choosing an appropriately specialized complex
     representation.  See the function *note
     upgraded-complex-part-type::.

upgraded array element type  n. (of a type)
     a type that is a supertype of the type and that is used instead of
     the type whenever the type is used as an array element type for
     object creation or type discrimination.  See *note Section
     15.1.2.1 (Array Upgrading): ArrayUpgrading.

upgraded complex part type  n. (of a type)
     a type that is a supertype of the type and that is used instead of
     the type whenever the type is used as a complex part type for
     object creation or type discrimination.  See the function *note
     upgraded-complex-part-type::.

uppercase  adj. (of a character)
     being among standard characters corresponding to the capital
     letters ‘A’ through ‘Z’, or being some other
     implementation-defined character that is defined by the
     implementation to be uppercase.  See *note Section 13.1.4.3
     (Characters With Case): CharactersWithCase.

use  v.t. (a package P₁)
     to inherit the external symbols of P₁.  (If a package P₂ uses P₁,
     the external symbols of P₁ become internal symbols of P₂ unless
     they are explicitly exported.)  "The package ‘CL-USER’ uses the
     package ‘CL’."

use list  n. (of a package)
     a (possibly empty) list associated with each package which
     determines what other packages are currently being used by that
     package.

user  n. 
     an active entity, typically a human, that invokes or interacts
     with a program at run time, but that is not necessarily a
     programmer.

V
=

valid array dimension  n. 
     a fixnum suitable for use as an array dimension.  Such a fixnum
     must be greater than or equal to zero, and less than the value of
     ‘array-dimension-limit’.  When multiple array dimensions are to be
     used together to specify a multi-dimensional array, there is also
     an implied constraint that the product of all of the dimensions be
     less than the value of ‘array-total-size-limit’.

valid array index  n. (of an array)
     a fixnum suitable for use as one of possibly several indices needed
     to name an element of the array according to a multi-dimensional
     Cartesian coordinate system. Such a fixnum must be greater than or
     equal to zero, and must be less than the corresponding dimension₁
     of the array.  (Unless otherwise explicitly specified, the phrase
     "a list of valid array indices" further implies that the length of
     the list must be the same as the rank of the array.)  "For a ‘2’
     by ‘3’ array, valid array indices for the first  dimension are ‘0’
     and ‘1’, and valid array indices for the second dimension are ‘0’,
     ‘1’ and ‘2’."

valid array row-major index  n. (of an array,
     which might have any number of dimensions₂) a single fixnum
     suitable for use in naming any element of the array, by viewing
     the array's storage as a linear series of elements in row-major
     order.  Such a fixnum must be greater than or equal to zero, and
     less than the array total size of the array.

valid fill pointer  n. (of an array)
     a fixnum suitable for use as a fill pointer for the array.  Such a
     fixnum must be greater than or equal to zero, and less than or
     equal to the array total size of the array.

valid logical pathname host  n.
     a string that has been defined as the name of a logical host.  See
     the function *note load-logical-pathname-translations::.

valid pathname device  n.
     a string, ‘nil’, :unspecific, or some other object defined by the
     implementation to be a valid pathname device.

valid pathname directory  n.
     a string, a list of strings, ‘nil’, :wild, :unspecific, or some
     other object defined by the implementation to be a valid directory
     component.

valid pathname host  n.
     a valid physical pathname host or a valid logical pathname host.

valid pathname name  n.
     a string, ‘nil’, :wild, :unspecific, or some other object defined
     by the implementation to be a valid pathname name.

valid pathname type  n.
     a string, ‘nil’, :wild, :unspecific.

valid pathname version  n.
     a non-negative integer, or one of :wild, :newest, :unspecific, or
     ‘nil’.  The symbols :oldest, :previous, and :installed are
     semi-standard special version symbols.

valid physical pathname host  n.
     any of a string, a list of strings, or the symbol :unspecific,
     that is recognized by the implementation as the name of a host.

valid sequence index  n. (of a sequence)
     an integer suitable for use to name an element of the sequence.
     Such an integer must be greater than or equal to zero, and must be
     less than the length of the sequence.  (If the sequence is an
     array, the valid sequence index is further constrained to be a
     fixnum.)

value  n. 
     1. a. one of possibly several objects that are the result of an
     evaluation.  b. (in a situation where exactly one value is
     expected from the evaluation of a form) the primary value returned
     by the form.  c. (of forms in an implicit progn) one of possibly
     several objects that result from the evaluation of the last form,
     or ‘nil’ if there are no forms.  2. an object associated with a
     name in a binding.  3. (of a symbol) the value of the dynamic
     variable named by that symbol.  4. an object associated with a key
     in an association list, a  property list, or a  hash table.

value cell  n. Trad. (of a symbol)
     The place which holds the value, if any, of the dynamic variable
     named by that symbol, and which is accessed by ‘symbol-value’.
     See *note cell: glos-cell.

variable  n. 
     a binding in the "variable" namespace.  See *note Section
     3.1.2.1.1 (Symbols as Forms): SymbolsAsForms.

vector  n. 
     a one-dimensional array.

vertical-bar  n.
     the standard character that is called "vertical bar" (‘|’).  See
     *note Figure 2.5: StdCharsThree.

whitespace  n. 
     1. one or more characters that are either the graphic character
     ‘#\Space’ or else non-graphic characters such as ‘#\Newline’ that
     only move the print position.  2. a. n. the syntax type of a
     character that is a token separator.  For details, see *note
     Section 2.1.4.7 (Whitespace Characters): WhitespaceChars.  b.
     adj. (of a character) having the whitespace[2a] syntax type₂.  c.
     n. a whitespace[2b] character.

wild  adj.
     1. (of a namestring) using an implementation-defined syntax for
     naming files, which might "match" any of possibly several possible
     filenames, and which can therefore be used to refer to the
     aggregate of the files named by those filenames.  2. (of a
     pathname) a structured representation of a name which might
     "match" any of possibly several pathnames, and which can therefore
     be used to refer to the aggregate of the files named by those
     pathnames.  The set of wild pathnames includes, but is not
     restricted to, pathnames which have a component which is :wild, or
     which have a directory component which contains :wild or
     :wild-inferors.  See the function *note wild-pathname-p::.

write  v.t. 
     1. (a binding or slot or component) to change the value of the
     binding or slot.  2. (an object to a stream) to output a
     representation of the object to the stream.

File: ansicl,  Node: Requirements for removed and deprecated features,  Next: Removed Types,  Up: Removed Language Features

A.1.1 Requirements for removed and deprecated features
------------------------------------------------------

For this standard, some features from the language described in `Common
Lisp: The Language' have been removed, and others have been deprecated
(and will most likely not appear in future Common Lisp standards).
Which features were removed and which were deprecated was decided on a
case-by-case basis by the X3J13 committee.

Conforming implementations that wish to retain any removed features for
compatibility must assure that such compatibility does not interfere
with the correct function of conforming programs.  For example, symbols
corresponding to the names of removed functions may not appear in the
the ‘COMMON-LISP’ package.  (Note, however, that this specification has
been devised in such a way that there can be a package named ‘LISP’
which can contain such symbols.)

Conforming implementations must implement all deprecated features.  For
a list of deprecated features, see *note Section 1.8 (Deprecated
Language Features): Deprecated Language Features.
